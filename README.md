# Description

This repository hosts the scripts used for data sonorization using the sonoUno tool and its associated libraries. It includes a set of scripts that allow scientific data to be transformed into accessible sound and visual representations.

# Main Features

### 1. Sonification with Noise:
   - The `sound_noise.py` cript enables the sonification of tabulated data in two columns, with the option to introduce controlled noise adjusted to a specific signal-to-noise ratio.
   - It includes the integration of the `pybrl` library, which automatically translates visual information (axis labels, graduations, and other elements) into Braille, ensuring the accessibility of generated graphs, which can also be 3D printed.

### 2. Sonorización de espectros estrellas:
   - The `starts.py` script is designed for the sonification of star spectra, facilitating the analysis and multisensory representation of this type of scientific data.
   - It includes the integration of the `pybrl` library, which automatically translates visual information (axis labels, graduations, and other elements) into Braille, ensuring the accessibility of generated graphs, which can also be 3D printed.

### 3. Sonorización de curvas de luz:
   - The `lightcurve.py` script allows the sonification of light curves.
   - It includes the integration of the `pybrl` library, which automatically translates visual information (axis labels, graduations, and other elements) into Braille, ensuring the accessibility of generated graphs, which can also be 3D printed.
